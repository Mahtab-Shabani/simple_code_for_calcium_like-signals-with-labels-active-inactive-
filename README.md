# simple code for calcium-like signals with labels (active/inactive)

### Calcium Imaging Signal Classification

This MATLAB code simulates synthetic calcium imaging signals representing active and inactive brain states. It extracts two key features to characterize each signal:
1. bandpower in the 0.5â€“4 Hz frequency range
2. Approximate entropy

Using these features, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained to distinguish between active and inactive states.

The script also visualizes example signals and their feature distribution, helping to understand how well the classifier separates the two classes.
